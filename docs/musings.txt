just a place to keep some random thoughts



friction joints to simulate z friction have to be updated when...
====================================

- a shape is added to the world

- a shape is removed from the world

- the world's gravityZ is changed

- a ubiquitous terrain is added, removed, or its z index changes

- there's contact or end contact with a non-ubiquitous terrain

- frictionZ of a shape changes

- shape mass/geometry changes

- a shape's body changes to/from kinematic

- a shapes frictionZ optimization mode changes (not yet implemented).
