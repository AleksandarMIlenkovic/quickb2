Quickest Start
==============

Open up an example in /examples/ and start hacking away.  The examples all have relative links to the various dependencies, so everything should just build and run.  FlashDevelop is required however.



Second Quickest
===============

Import /swc/QuickB2.swc into the IDE of your choice and copy/paste some code from examples/Helloqb2World or something to get started.



Third Quickest
==============

Read through the manual in /docs/ and then do 'Second Quickest'.
